## Components ##

### Bootloader ###

It uses a custom bootloader, which is an efi application so it can be loaded by any efi boot manager.

### Kernel ###

The kernel has almost no work done, but it goes in tandem with the bootloader and both are of the AMD64 architecture

## Toolchain ##

Right now it's GCC, but I hope to migrate everything to clang
